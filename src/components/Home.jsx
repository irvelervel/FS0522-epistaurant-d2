// The final feature of today is about generating dynamically a list of reviews
// The reviews should belong to the last slide (pasta) we clicked on
// ...this involves our Home component remembering which is the last pasta
// we clicked on! ...which is the currently selected pasta
// we'd like to add to the Home component a "memory"... a state!

// Let's add a state to the Home component
// We can add a state to any CLASS COMPONENT
// ...and Home unfortunately right now is a FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT :(
// so, let's convert Home to become a Class Component :)

  // we have EVERY TIME to create our own class components extending
  // Component, which is the main class component React has to offer

  // now that we have a Class Component, we can use some superpowers
  // like e.g. the STATE OBJECT

  // the state object is a short-term memory for a Class Component
  // it will help you remembering things or keeping its internal state tidy

  // let's create this state!
  state = {
    // it has to be called state!

    // done! now we can put here anything we'd like to remember

    // value is going to be null
